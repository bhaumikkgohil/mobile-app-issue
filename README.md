This is the Repo for the authentication issue I found on the TicTacToe application we made.

a. What is your security recommendation? Why did you choose it?
Recommendation: Implement user authentication (e.g., Firebase Authentication) to uniquely identify each user.

Reason:
Currently, the app uses player names to store and retrieve scores. If two players use the same name, their scores will merge, causing a data conflict and incorrect score tracking. By implementing user authentication, each user will have a unique identifier (such as a UID from Firebase), eliminating the possibility of name-based conflicts and ensuring accurate score association.

b. Who does the recommendation benefit (end-user, developer, etc.)?
•	End-User: Users will have personalized score records without the risk of overlap or incorrect updates.
•	Developer: It simplifies data handling by reducing the need for additional logic to handle duplicate names and ensures the integrity of user data.

c. If the recommendation was found somewhere other than the provided checklist, include a link to it.
This recommendation is part of the provided checklist under the Authentication section.

d. When would the recommendation have to be implemented (based on how serious the security risk is)?
•	The recommendation should be implemented before deployment of the application. The name-based data conflict is a high-priority issue that directly impacts the app's functionality and user experience.

e. Why do you think your project needs your recommendation?
•	The recommendation addresses the critical issue of user identification in the app. Without authentication, players with the same name cannot reliably use the app, as their scores will be incorrectly updated or merged. This significantly impacts the app's usability and data integrity. Authentication ensures that every user’s data remains distinct and secure.

f. How do you think your recommendation could be applied?
Implementation Steps:
1.	Integrate Firebase Authentication into the app to allow users to sign in using email, phone, or other supported methods.
2.	Use the UID generated by Firebase as the unique identifier for storing and retrieving player data in Firestore.
3.	Update the database structure to replace the name-based logic with UID-based logic for tracking scores.
Feasibility:
•	The implementation is highly feasible since the app already uses Firebase Firestore. Firebase Authentication integrates seamlessly with Firestore, requiring minimal additional setup.
